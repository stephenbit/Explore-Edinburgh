  "body": "\"<h3 style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">We never thought the first Fringe review would be of a Street Performer. If you follow us on <a href=\\\"http://www.instagram.com/p/BmK2U8gAi_c/\\\">Instagram</a> , you might know that we have been to fair few shows this year. While we enjoyed all of them, the one which entertained us the most was <a href=\\\"http://www.facebook.com/TheAtariShow/\\\">The Atari Show</a>.</h3>   <p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">His show was on Chambers Street, right in front of the steps to the National Museum of Scotland. We were on the opposite side of the road and his antics really caught our eye. Normally, we avoid street performers because many of them spend 20-30 minutes building up to their performance only for it to transpire that they only have 5 minutes of material. <strong><em>This was different.</em></strong> We were already at the end of a long day and were on our way home, but there was something magnetic about this performance.</p>   https://www.facebook.com/ExploreEdinburgh/videos/551492441950327/   <p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">We couldn't stop ourselves from crossing the road and getting ourselves positioned right in the middle of the stage. I should have mentioned by now: his stage is the road, the pavement, the steps and even the opposite pavement. He dominates the whole area and tries to involve as many passers-by as he can. From cars to children to the elderly, he involves everyone to huge hilarity. His antics range from pretending to push a van along the road, while it is stuck in traffic to chasing pedestrians with a remote controlled shark fin. For every situation, he has a piece of music, a funny sound effect or a cool prop. Speaking of props, he has with him a huge box full of them. Every time he reached his hand into his prop box, I thought that he must be about to repeat a previous joke but he rarely did and I was constantly surprised by the variety in this show. On the rare occasion that he did repeat a gag, it was completely worth it and perhaps even more funny than the previous time.</p>   <a href=\\\"https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPPwLhd5Fsf2WR8keglMlRCZRhxsUOhSupwFGpGyldbppPWnt_yFhpbhveNypu1JQ?key=QWxDM1F5RnBKbXd0N2xvUDV4N1UxY3pyc1JqdnBB&amp;source=ctrlq.org\\\"><img src=\\\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UtE1INU-Ldb0tR9TYOn3R6164yTsZAMV-KADYy5uB7ErqLAcIXCbcKE0qThZAU6tRZlzOTSH2-0vUGUJ3mc79A1iVZfYAH_dshBjZ98PAScSJ3dBD6pSWgS6W3Y6e6Gj63NvS3idXos=w2400\\\" /></a>   <p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\">We at Explore Edinburgh thoroughly enjoyed every second of it and laughed for the duration. Please seek out this wonderfully talented improvisational street performer before he moves on to another city.</p>\""

  "body": "<h2>With its stunning scenery and well-maintained footpaths, this walk is as easy on the eye as it is on the legs. Starting at <a href=\\\"https://goo.gl/maps/6BwsQ51FMbu\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">The Juniper Green Inn</a> and heading down the hill, you will reach the start of this splendid 1 - 1.5 hour walk.</h2>   <strong>Getting there</strong>   <ul>       <li>By car: there is plenty of free on street parking in Juniper Green</li>       <li>By public transport: take either bus routes <a href=\\\"http://www.lothianbuses.com/maps-and-times/network-maps/?service_name=44\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">44</a> or <a href=\\\"https://www.lothianbuses.com/maps-and-times/network-maps/?service_name=45\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">45</a> and get off at Baberton Avenue, right next to The Juniper Green Inn.</li>   </ul>   After walking down from the busy main road at Juniper Green, the first thing you will notice is how quiet and serene the area is. As well as being set back from the road, the path is also shielded from the noise by the abundance of trees. You will cross a number of bridges- both ancient and modern- all of which provide excellent photo opportunities.      [gallery ids=\\\"47,48\\\" type=\\\"columns\\\" link=\\\"file\\\"]      A little further on, you will come to Spylaw Park which really is a lovely place to stop off for half an hour or so. The park is vast and surrounded by many interesting trees. If you're lucky, you might see a variety of of dog breeds running around and playing.      As you exit the park via the northeastern end, you will come across a very striking old building. This will be the mansion of local historical figure and philanthropist, <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gillespie_(philanthropist)\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">James Gillespie</a>. Gillespie made his fortune as a snuff merchant and built the house in 1773 right next to his snuff-mill. Gillespie requested that upon his death, his fortune should be used to build a hospital and a school for the poor.      [caption id=\\\"attachment_54\\\" align=\\\"alignnone\\\" width=\\\"4032\\\"]<img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-54\\\" src=\\\"https://exploreedinburghorg.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/img_4347.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"IMG_4347\\\" width=\\\"4032\\\" height=\\\"3024\\\" /> The mansion of James Gillespie[/caption]      Next up is the car park where, until 1943, was the location of <a href=\\\"https://www.railscot.co.uk/locations/C/Colinton/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Colinton Rail Station</a>, part of the Balerno branch. Keep going a little further and you will come across the old train tunnel which now has a cycle path running through it. Around this area, those with a keen eye might spot a heron or a kingfisher. The tunnel is well lit enough to be able to see all the interesting graffiti on the walls. In fact, along with the bare brick walls, the old style orange street lighting only makes this location more atmospheric.      https://www.instagram.com/p/BmvSiKeAnO7/      The rest of the hike is more of the same, relaxing riverside walk that you will have become accustomed to, over the course of the last hour. At this point, there are a number of different paths you can take to continue and they all head much in the same direction. There will be a path turning left to take you to the Union Canal, but we chose to stick to the path which is closest to the river.      [gallery ids=\\\"56,51,49,52\\\" type=\\\"slideshow\\\"]      Eventually, you will end up at the <a href=\\\"http://www.waterofleith.org.uk/centre/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Water of Leith Visitor Centre</a> which is well worth a visit if it happens to be open when you arrive. From here, you can head up onto the canal and check out Slateford Viaduct or it's just 25 minutes to the city centre from here. If you drove to Juniper Green, it's only 15 minutes back up the hill on the <a href=\\\"https://www.lothianbuses.com/maps-and-times/network-maps/?service_name=44\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">44</a> bus.

  "body": "<h3>At the beginning of August, we were walking down Chambers Street when I heard bellowing coming from South Bridge. Across the street, there was a kilted man shouting \\\"there will be no blue painted faces, there will be no fantasy french princesses \\\" and something about a 5 star reviewed show... I was intrigued.</h3>   https://youtu.be/kEqdI7f7hdo      We were on our way somewhere so we couldn't watch it but we walked over and said hello to him and took a flyer. Fast forward to last Saturday and I had a hankering for hearing a tale from the tomes of Scottish history. It was just as well because that was exactly what was on offer with this show by <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/McsherryAlex\\\">Alex McSherry</a>. The show was part of the <a href=\\\"https://freefringe.org.uk/\\\">PBH Free Fringe</a> lineup and, like everything I've seen from the PBH programme over the years, it didn't disappoint. The show starts with a bang on the door and in pours McSherry, this time completely immersed in character. It is at this point that we are introduced to Alec, a Tanner recently bereaved of his wife and son. After going over the basics of soaking animal skins, he begins to recount the time he spent making leather items for William Wallace. Next comes a no holds barred retelling of the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Stirling_Bridge\\\">Battle of Stirling Bridge</a> with all the blood, guts, death and heroism intact. It was a very dynamic performance which sees McSherry utilise his booming voice to great effect, as well as some quieter and sombre moments.      Indeed, his stage presence was very commanding and the drama was riveting enough that a small interruption by a couple of latecomers wasn't enough to take me out of the action, so to speak. A true masterclass in performing arts and storytelling.      <img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-75\\\" src=\\\"https://exploreedinburghorg.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/img_5201.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"IMG_5201\\\" width=\\\"1280\\\" height=\\\"960\\\" />      While there are plenty of laughs in this show, it is by no means a comedy. When McSherry warns people against coming if they are easily offended, he isn't kidding. The Tanners Tale is a no-compromising, graphic retelling of a period in Scottish history too often stripped of its accuracy in the pursuit of accessibility and romanticism.      <em>Although this was the final showing of The Tanners Tale for this Fringe season, Alex mentioned that the show will be returning to Edinburgh at some point so keep an eye out for it! <strong>You can find Alex McSherry on <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/mcsherryalex\\\">Twitter</a>.</strong></em>"

  "body": "Edinburgh has a fantastic lineup of regular markets all over the city. I will keep this page up to date, if any details change. While most of the stalls accept only cash, there are a few which accept card payments, particularly stalls selling clothing and art. Of the stalls which accept card payment, not all of them advertise this fact, so don't be afraid to ask as all stall holders are super friendly. Failing that, there is never an ATM too far from any of the markets in Edinburgh.   <h1>Grassmarket Saturday Market</h1>   If you're ever on the Grassmarket on a Saturday, it will be impossible for you to not spot this market.      Day: Every Saturday      Time: 10am - 5pm      Location: <a href=\\\"https://goo.gl/maps/DTTeKSJ4gZD2\\\">Grassmarket Square, EH1 2JR</a>      Nearby bus routes: <a href=\\\"https://www.lothianbuses.com/maps-and-times/network-maps/?service_name=2\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">2</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.lothianbuses.com/maps-and-times/network-maps/?service_name=23\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">23</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.lothianbuses.com/maps-and-times/network-maps/?service_name=27\\\">27</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.lothianbuses.com/maps-and-times/network-maps/?service_name=41\\\">41</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.lothianbuses.com/maps-and-times/network-maps/?service_name=42\\\">42</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.lothianbuses.com/maps-and-times/network-maps/?service_name=67\\\">67</a>      Nearest ATM: <a href=\\\"https://goo.gl/maps/yijSPz1HNd12\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Premier Festival Stores</a>      [gallery ids=\\\"96,98\\\" type=\\\"square\\\" columns=\\\"2\\\" link=\\\"none\\\"]      At this market, you'll find everything from paella and fresh cakes to framed portraits and jewellery. My personal favourite is the sausage roll stall run by <a href=\\\"https://www.ossorestaurant.com/\\\">Osso Restaurant</a> in Peebles. At over £3 each. you'll probably find the prices here to be a little higher than a typical sausage roll but that's precisely because <em>these are anything but your typical sausage rolls.</em> While the pastry is certainly better than most other bakers I've tried, it's the fillings which make these pies something extra special. Haggis, neeps and tatties, Philly steak and spicy lamb just to name a few. Speaking of lamb, it's not minced lamb- it's a tasty, tender cut of lamb perfectly cooked and spiced. Same for the beef, too- it's a cut of meat and not minced. I'm yet to try the other flavours but I plan to.      <img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-90\\\" src=\\\"https://exploreedinburghorg.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/img_1162.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"IMG_1162\\\" width=\\\"960\\\" height=\\\"1280\\\" />   <h1>Edinburgh Farmers’ Market</h1>   Just up the hill from Grassmarket on Castle Terrace, you'll find Edinburgh Farmers’ Market, which hosts stalls filled with local fresh fruits and vegetables.

There are local cheeses,  honey and of course more fruits and vegetables than you'll know what to do with. There's also a big selection of game, fish and lobster here. In the winter, there's a fantastic selection of squashes. When we last visited, we had a salad and quiche box from <a href=\\\"https://www.falklandkitchenfarm.co.uk/\\\">Falkland Kitchen Farm</a>. There, you get salad from their farm along with a slice of pie or quiche, all boxed up ready to eat on a bench or to take home.      <img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-91\\\" src=\\\"https://exploreedinburghorg.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/img_0618.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"IMG_0618.JPG\\\" width=\\\"4032\\\" height=\\\"3024\\\" />   <h1>Stockbridge Market</h1>   Hosted right on the bank of the Water of Leith is the much beloved <a href=\\\"http://www.stockbridgemarket.com/stockbridge.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Stockbridge Market</a>. At this market, you'll find many of the staples of Edinburgh markets but the one thing I noticed which makes this one stand apart was the variety of street food. Everyone's favourite paella stall was there, but also curry and crepes and soup.

I regret that I didn't buy any but I will be trying some next time I am at the market.

  "body": "<strong>Surgeons' Hall</strong> in Edinburgh, Scotland, is the headquarters of the <a href=\\\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Surgeons_of_Edinburgh\\\">Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh</a>. It is best known for housing the museums of Pathology, History of Surgery and The Dental Collection.      ‘Robinson Crusoe’ author, <a href=\\\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Defoe\\\">Daniel Defoe</a> wrote in 1976 that “the 'chamber of rarities' contained many curious things too numerous for him to describe.” Since then, the collection has more than doubled. While the original Surgeons Hall was completed in 1697, the current building was opened in 1832 after it was decided that the collection of medical artefacts had grown too large for the premises.      <img src=\\\"https://exploreedinburghorg.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/img_3207.jpg\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-105 size-full\\\" height=\\\"3024\\\" width=\\\"4032\\\">      <a href=\\\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bell\\\">Joseph Bell</a> was president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh between. He was a popular teacher noted for his diagnostic abilities which he based on his powers of observation of meticulous detail. One of his more well-known students was <a href=\\\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle\\\">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> who would later give up medicine to become a writer. After having achieved fame and wealth through the Sherlock Holmes stories, wrote to his former tutor \\\"...it is most certainly to you that I owe Sherlock Holmes.”      If you are at all queasy by the sight of body parts in jars, I would strongly recommend that you try to push past it and give this fascinating place a visit, next time you’re in the area. Some of the more mainstream artefacts house there is a collection of writings by Arthur Conan Doyle and a death mask of local serial killer, William Burke as well as a pocket book made from his skin.
